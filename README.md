## Usage

### Fetch Reviews by Search Query
Retrieve reviews for the closest product on Amazon based on a search query.
```python
from src.amazon import AmazonScraper

search_query = 'ipad air'
scraper = AmazonScraper()

reviews = scraper.get_closest_product_reviews(search_query, num_reviews=25)

print(reviews)
# [{'customer_name': 'Kenova Pelletier', 'rating': 1, 'review': 'This looked amazing out of the box...
```

### Fetch Reviews by ASIN
Retrieve reviews for a specific product on Amazon using its ASIN.
```python
from src.amazon import AmazonScraper

product_asin = 'B08J65DST5'
scraper = AmazonScraper()

reviews = scraper.get_product_reviews_by_asin(product_asin, num_reviews=25)

print(reviews)
# [{'customer_name': 'carol anderson', 'rating': 1, 'review': 'This was my first Apple product...
```

#### Debug Flag
The `get_closest_product_reviews` and `get_product_reviews_by_asin` methods also have a `debug` flag available that outputs the total time taken for execution.

```python
search_query = 'ipad air'
scraper = AmazonScraper()

reviews = scraper.get_closest_product_reviews(search_query, num_reviews=5, debug=True)
# 13.47 seconds taken
```

```python
product_asin = 'B08J65DST5'
scraper = AmazonScraper()

reviews = scraper.get_product_reviews_by_asin(product_asin, num_reviews=5, debug=True)
# 10.12 seconds taken
```

## Command Line Usage
You can also use this tool from the command line to fetch reviews by either search query or ASIN.

#### Fetch Reviews by Search Query (CLI)
```sh
python src/amazon.py --query "ipad air" 5 --headless --debug
```

#### Fetch Reviews by ASIN (CLI)
```sh
python src/amazon.py --asin "B08J65DST5" 5 --headless --debug

Note that the `--headless` and the `--debug` flags are optional.
